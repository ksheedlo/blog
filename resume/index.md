<h2 class="Post-header">Open Source</h2>

By way of my Google internship, I'm an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) alum
and still send PRs their way on occasion. I've also contributed code to various
other projects and have a few cool ones of my own. Check out my
[github](https://github.com/ksheedlo) for more details.

<h2 class="Post-header">Skills</h2>

I'm proficient in JavaScript, Python, Java, Scala and C. I know enough x86 
assembly to be dangerous. I've built web servers with Django and Flask, and
single-page apps in Angular and jQuery. I've written interpreters and compiler
passes and printf exploits. There are so many interesting things to do, and I
feel like I've barely scratched the surface!
