description: Slides from a tech talk on the new error system in AngularJS.
---

I'm posting my slides from a short tech talk I gave today on my summer intern
project with the AngularJS team. The project is called **minerr**. The idea is
to take error messages out of the minified build of Angular. This allows you to
have longer error messages that are more descriptive and helpful without
contributing to code bloat or adding any weight. I'll be following up with a
longer post on the Angular blog sometime next week, but for now here are my
slides. Unfortunately, lines break in weird places in the small view, so go full
screen for the best experience.

Let me know what you think! I'm also happy to answer any questions in the
comments.
