Oh, snap.

![](/assets/oh_snap_sm.jpg)

I'm just a guy who writes Javascript and occasionally tweets and blogs about it.
I work at Rackspace as a User Interface Engineer where I'm passionate about
building exceptional web UIs. Other things I'm passionate about may include
photography, snowboarding and coming up with a great hack. You should
[read my blog](/).

This site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It used to be hosted
on [Github](https://github.com); now the host is a secret. The source code is
still [available on Github](https://github.com/ksheedlo/blog). Don't be a dick
in the comments, or you will be able to see them go away there.
